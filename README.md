# 100 Days of Code - Data Structures and Algorithms Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days of Code Challenge dedicated to improving your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills! This repository is designed to provide you with a structured and effective way to enhance your understanding of DSA concepts and coding skills over the course of 100 days.

## Overview

This challenge is aimed at both beginners and intermediate-level programmers who want to master DSA for coding interviews, or just to become better problem solvers. The goal is to consistently practice and learn new concepts each day for 100 days.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

-   A basic understanding of programming fundamentals in a language of your choice (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
-   An account in Leetcode , CodeStudio or GeeksForGeeks
-   Little bit of motivation

### Repository Structure

-   **/100DAYSOFCODE**: Contains a subdirectory for each day of the challenge (e.g., `/Day1`, `/Day2`, etc.). Each day's directory will have a Python file with specific questions or links to those questions with solutions for the day. You can expect to find three problems for each day as you aim to solve three problems daily.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to this repository by:

-   Adding new DSA challenges and exercises.
-   Improving existing solutions.
-   Providing feedback or suggestions for improvement.
-   Helping fellow participants by reviewing their code and offering guidance.

To contribute, please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
